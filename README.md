A simple leak of a stealer that show up on as lot of python program as dualhook

I don't have that much to say, except using "Fernet" is not that useful, making fake blocked page too! and just being the

The stealer is hidden inside a lot of program, fake stealer, fake tools etc.. using the ; technique.

```py
import requests                                                                ;exec("code")
```

It is doing requests.get() to a website and remove tag to get the code hidden inside of the fake Cloudflare blocked webpage
